# Economic strategy

To payoff the efforts towards Orivon to contributors, involveds, devs, funder etc… Orivon needs a way to get an income

That has to be done while keeping the cores of web3 philosophy, using a fair strategy for the benefit of the world and at the same time giving a well compensation on merits at those who made the project possible in the first place

As usual you can leave feedbacks and improvements with a post down there


## Sources

Orivon by it's nature is very well placed, willing to be the spine for the future of Web3

That gaves us a lot of space to have great sources of income without compromising the User Experience at all

Let's dive deep into these


### Featured Sites, Apps and Integrations

Compliant DApps, Sites and Integrations with a good level of [Web3 Score](implementations/web3-score) are elegible for being featured on Orivon

These featuring will be offered in different ways:

- **Pre-installed integrations**
- **Pre-inserted in the Dashboard**
- **Featured in the Orivon Appstore**
- **Featured in Dashboard widget search**
- **Shown during web searches**
- **Shown in the Dashboard**

New or different ways be added in the future

#### Price influencing factors

Then there are some factor influencing the price of the Sponsor and it’s priority by other bidders

- **Trustlessity level**, the lower the Trustlessity level is, the lower the sponsor is going to be in priority, meaning that’s going to cost more
- **Commission impact**, the more commissions a sponsored applies to it's users, the higher it's price is going to be

Security level is non-negotiable we will always opt for the safest solutions

### Default search engine

A sponsor may want to pay to become the default search engine on the Browser, in this case, only engines with a focus on Web3 Search results are prioritized

Even in this case, lower Trustlessity level translates to higher cost

### Web3 Scoring provider

If you read [Web3 Scores](implementations/web3-score) you already know that a provider to give these judgments should exhist  
Orivon aims to be a Web3 Score provider trough it's DAO

Obviosly doing that for the entire Internet for all new or less known projects isn't an easy task, the same applies for any update, which requires a new Web3 Score evaluation

Web3sites, Apps and Integrations can pay a single time, or a subscription, to get faster priority on getting Web3 Scores, subscriptions would guarantee also fast evaluation for each released update

Regardless of that, Orivon will always try to cover as much services as possible with a Web3 Score, that serves mostly to boost this process and guarantee it's relaiance and operationality
