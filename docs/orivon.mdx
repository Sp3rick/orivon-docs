# The Orivon Project

Welcome to the Orivon Project documentation, here you will find every bit of information you need to know about the project and how you can become part of it

So glad to have you here, here's the opportunity to take Web3 usage widespread across the entire world

## The Ultimate Web3 Browser

<img src={OrivonDashboardConcept} alt="OrivonDashboardConcept" width="800" style={{ display: "block" }}/>

<small style={{ display: "block", marginBottom: "1rem"  }}>Take this only as an experimental and illustrative image</small>

We believe we have created the perfect design for a truly web3 browsing system of the future and we share the Orivon Project ideals to make all of that true

The idea of a *truly web3* Browser looks like inevitable for the Web3 future and gives huge improvement in the User Experience, as well with huge improvement for developers experience to create Web3 apps

We are aware that our statements sound impressive, but once you learn more about Orivon you may start agreeing with these as well.

Feedbacks, questions, [discussions](https://orivonstack.com) or critiques are part of project for improvement and general web3 community knowledge sharing, feel free to share your opinion trough any of [our channels](more/our-channels)


### Web3 problems

One of first the problems preventing web3 mass adoption are *absence of easyness and cleariness*, peoples has no clue what is web3 and what's not (see FTX case on public opinion)

Using it is actually hard for common peoples, involves high risks for them, and mosts doesn't understand it's values and uses. Furthermore, the one most of us uses isn't event the actual trustless web3, but a trusted web2.5 temporary solution.

Right now there are some tested ways to access a "web3" in a trustless manner, like IPFS, Decentralized DNS, or accessing specific protocols by installing some sort of programs (ex. Bisq, Atomic swaps, Nodes) but these are only usable and safe for tech users

*Normal Browsers limitations prevents running most of web3 things on-the-fly*

By an user perspective, everything is disconnected, nothing provides a clear web3 experience worth of the big public attention

But it's understandable, technologies takes a while until *a way* to make them easly accessible is found, Orivon proposes to be *the way*.

Furthermore there are some other reasons preventing Web3 from getting worldwide widespread:

- **Peoples thinks it hasn't practical uses,** and we can't blame them for it, only tech users willing to dive deep into web3 and experience it does understand it's incredible value, when experiencing web3 will be easy for everyone, then everyone will understand once for all how game-changing this technology is
  

- **We use Web2 solutions to access Web3 protocols,** you open uniswap.com, you are using a centralized DNS, then you get site data from the Uniswap host (hoping it's not compromised), then maybe it goes well

  Big public can't look at Web3 seriously if it's current state is like this, we need to go truly Web3

  Web3 is not just about supporting IPFS or a decentralized domain, is about owning capabilities, other than IPFS should be usable anything else too, like Arweave, Torrent, the Ethereum blockchain

- **Going truly web3 is for technicals,** running interfaces locally, installing programs (and for each of them set up a wallet), running nodes, installing trustless DEX'es like Bisq and all of these things are made mostly by technical users

  For each web3 operation *download install open setup*... what if we improve it to just *open*?  
  Most peoples sees installing new programs as an hard task, imagine even letting them setup a wallet each time they do it, peoples doesn't want all of that headache.

  This is what prevents widespread adoption of Web3 socials, DeFi, Web3sites, Web3 governance systems and everything else from Web3 technologies

- **There aren't established ways to acces web3 resources,** peoples doesn't know how to find Web3 things, and for each of these find if it's actually Web3, trustless and possibly safe. That causes uncertainty and insecurity feeling on peoples

  That's why it's needed a place ready for specific access and search of web3 resources


The fact is, we all know that these problems, along with Web2 solutions to access Web3 protocols are just temporary and are going to be replaced when web3 community will come up with a better solution, but the solution is right here, it's called Orivon, and aims to solve exactly all of that

## Solution and revolution

<small style={{ display: "block", marginBottom: "1rem"  }}>Take this only as an experimental and illustrative image</small>

Orivon gives a solution willing to change the entire Web3 Experience, both for users and developers

**Users** will benefit from and extremly good UX, ease and fast use of different Web3 programs just by opening a url (ex. bisq.eth), easly know how much trustless and safe the current visited site or the current operation is, eventually with a privacy indicator  

Feeling safe into the Web3 has never been that easy  

A store or web3 engine to search trough the most trustless and safe web3sites, get special extensions to expand the browser trustless capabilities (like more decentralized domains, more ways to load other than IPFS, more kinds of wallets etc...)  
[And much more](#applications--also-called-special-extensions-)

**Developers** will benefit from a divine time saving, needing to build only frontend and protocol, stuffs like wallet management, network management and security is already handled by Orivon, no more need of unnecessary work  

Creating special extensions to expand browser capabilites, like Wallet management (to add new crypto) and network management (to add new network, like Ethereum or Torrent) is made very easy inside the Orivon framework while giving out your special extension functions in a standardized way   

And once your special extension in made, the entire Web3 world will be easily able to use it even on-fly  
Building a web3site with Orivon for a dev means building in a powerfull ecosystem with both ease of build and user experience, which incentivizes huges waves of users to your product


## Orivon Implementation

It's the moment to dive deep into how Orivon actually works and how it solve all of this problems and drastically improve the User Experience

If you want more implementation details of certain components you can also look up at [**Implementations**](category/implementations)  
But first, if you already didn't, take a look on the main features

### Applications <small style={{ display: "block", marginTop: 0, fontWeight: "normal", fontSize: "0.50em", lineHeight: 1.2, marginBottom: "-3em"}}> Also called special extensions </small>

Almost every component is possibly extended or modified by Apps, they can be installed as easly as browser extensions or ran on-fly by web3sites, and they goes for:
- **Dashboard:** The application used to show up the Dashboard in new tabs of the browser - [*Orivon Dashboard*](implementations/dashboard-app)
- **DNS resolution** - [*details*](implementations/dns-resolution)
- **Data Gathering** (ex. IPFS, Arweave, Blockchain etc...) - [*details*](implementations/data-gathering)
- **Accounts:** an account may be based on mnemonic, hardware wallet, abstracted and anything else by App logic
- **Crypto:** implementing a new crypto like Monero, BSQ Tokens, etc... 
- **Address list:** implementing a new address list out of an implemented ***Crypto*** for all compatible ***Accounts***, it could be the default address list itself, or vanity address generator, or anything else by app logic
- **Network** (ex. implementing access for Bitcoin network, or Tor network, or IPFS Network, Torrent, or Bisq pricenode etc...)
- **Web3 Score provider:** one or more providers can provide the data for the [trustlessity and security scores](#trustlessity--security-score) during the user activity

The [*Wallet system*](implementations/wallet-system) component shares an interesting point for DeFi users, which is DApps for Crypto that has never been trustlessly possible from a website: Bitcoin, Monero, ZCash, BSQ etc...  

That's going to open doors for DApps at Atomic Swaps, Escrow transactions with multisig or time-lock and way more

### Trustlessity & Security Score

Trustlessity and Security scores are features which allows users to have an easy understanding of what they are using, it easly allows to understand:

- How trustless and actually Web3 this is?
- How realistically safe this specific operation is?
- (bonus) Is that reasonably privacy preserving?

Imagine the user who asks "Is this site trustless? Is it Web3?"  
If it's a .com site it's *not trustless*  
If it's a .eth connected to IPFS yes  
But if it gives you a bank IBAN to receive money without informing the user about the non-trustlessity of it, it's not trustless.  
If without user control it relies on data from centralized parties, it's not trustless, simple as that.

Furthermore user needs to know the safety of the Operation he is performing, maybe you can yeld some trustless stablecoin for a 400% estimated annual income, *but it doesn't mean it's safe*

These 2 scores improves the user sense of safety drammatically, it's a game changer to bring huge trust into the Web3 field, with honest and realistic evaluations playing a key role on that

[So, who gives the evaluations?](implementations/web3-score)

[How evaluations system works?](implementations/web3-score)


### Advanced WASM: Programs on-fly

Current browsers limitations forces most of Web3 codebases to get independent and build their own separate program

That's because browsers like Chrome or Firefox does not allow access to important **network functions** (which would allow to open a bitcoin node, or just connecting to Torrent), extremely limited **storage access**, limited **cpu/gpu** access which is sometimes needed for speed and optimization purposes, and some others **OS Function**  

Orivon aims to implement the access of these needed functions in a controlled and safe envrioment so that most of Web3 codebases can run as a web3site just by opening a url

It translates into run a true Bitcoin Node on a bitcoinnode.eth, use Torrent just by opening torrentclient.eth, use your Monero wallet on a featherwallet.eth, use bisq on a bisq.eth, using a Tor connection just trough torproxy.eth, and way way way more, there is an ocean of possibilities, it really breaks the perception of how we interact with Web3 today entirely  

It's a basilar concept that should be the default on Web3 field, and ***once you see it you can't unsee it***

#### For developers

You are completly free to use any language you want as long it supports WASM compiling

As for the frontend part, it's exactly the same as the nowadays frontend developing, you can use HTML and it's related tools, or keep using WASM to use instead Canvas/WebGL/WebGPU

That means that bitcoind of [bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) would be already runnable as a site on Orivon, and it would require just to write a web frontend for it


### Other features

#### Web3 Applications store

Orivon will feature a store specifically for [Applications](#applications--also-called-special-extensions-) which expands the browser capabilities

As the Web3 Score, if someone else comes before us on building a better store with suitable Trustlessity, Security and Privacy, we will adopt that as default

Otherwise, we will build it

Implementation details of a store aren't still been made, if you want to contribute look at our documentation github or talk on our forum  
Anyway we plan it to have the following basics: 

- The store should prioritize the results with best Web3 Score based on the browser provider
- The entire store should be considered enough Trustless, Secure and Privacy conserving
- UI and Features inspired by F-Droid

#### Web3 Search

Web3 Search engines will be already integrated, possibly engines who mixes Web2 and Web3 but still with a focus on prioritizing Trustlessity, Security and Privacy, along with Web3 Score indicator integrated

We have some canditates which we may opt to collaborate in future to make all of that possible  
Currently these candidates are: [web3compass](https://www.web3compass.net/) and [0xapps](https://0xapps.com/), but as right now take them just as examples

If nothing will fit Orivon needs, we may end up creating our own Web3 Search engine

#### Installable Web3sites

Every single Web3site will be actually downloadable and runnable locally

By definition, if you are a Web3site is because it's trustless, meaning that you can completely run it locally  
Then you are still in control of all collateral requirements, such as Network, Data Gathering, Crypto implementations etc... 

#### DDOC

***D**omain **D**ata **O**wnership **C**onfirmation*

DDOC can be seen as an additional security layer after HTTPS, it serves to verify that the data you received are exactly what the domain owner wanted you to receive

That prevents incidents caused by remote server hacking and assures Data Integrity  

DDOC could be implemented into conventional Hosts/IP data gathering (see Native DDOC Support), or already implemented by design with protocols like IPFS

It's intended by design that at least the first file downloaded during the website loading, is predictable, so that the Domain Owner will declare that he wanted it to be there  

That's the doorway to let Web3 Score verifications possible, since an identification Hash will be alway available when DDOC is supported, lack of DDOC makes hard by technical and practical level to trust a website declaring to be Web3


#### Connections Settings

Orivon will add 2 new options in settings

**Nodes Configuration**, each Network App will add their option in nodes configuration, these will allow to manage what node to use, and optionally to run one, there are multiple ways which will allows users to easily run a node

- Directly run it from the Network App itself (if running Nodes is supported)
- Use another integrated App capable of running that node
- Find an integrated App which can run that kind of node on [Web3 Store](orivon#web3-applications-store)

**Socks5 Configuration** Apps can both create a Socks5 proxy or use a Socks5 proxy to route all of their traffic  
A better UI will show Apps providing Socks5 Proxy access along with App icon, anyway custom ip address Socks5 proxy can still be choosen  

You can also set a Socks5 proxy for the entire browser, but specific App proxy settings will override it anyway

## Get Involved in Orivon

Orivon is a community supported project, and by it's own nature, it's placing as a Browser willing change the entire Web3 ecosystem with new standards, and then get adopted worldwide, for that reason Orivon has to be backed by a big and valuable community

It does not matter what your skills currently are, there are very valuable roles which you can take part into Orivon, once you get involved efforts will be paid out with a fair amount of governance tokens into the Orivon DAO once it will be finally launched

More details for [**Getting involved**](involving) are in the following page, hop in!
