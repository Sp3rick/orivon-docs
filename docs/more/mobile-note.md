# About Mobile

Currently we haven't a developed design of how Orivon should exactly look like on Mobile

In the meanwhile, our current design is tought and made with the long term goal to be compabile with future Mobile implementations

Developers of Web3sites, Apps and Integrations should not worry, your code will be able to run on Mobile devices once Orivon will support them, the only major headache will be Frontend adaptments, which are obvious and inevitable

We will update this page once a clearer plan on Mobile will is enstablished
