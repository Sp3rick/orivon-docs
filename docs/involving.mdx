# Get Involved

Getting involved into Orivon is not just contributing on a project, it's building the future of the Web3  

Becoming part of Orivon means having a chance to place you as one of the founding fathers who changed Web3 forever  
Means that you know Orivon leads to improve drastically the Web3 ecosystem and make it ready for the worldwide adoption  
And finally make Web3 a widespread technology

We can build big things togheter, and here I will explain how you can do it

## How I can get involved

It does not matter what your skills currently are, there are very valuable roles which you can take part into Orivon, once you get involved efforts will be paid out with a fair amount of governance tokens into the Orivon DAO once it will be finally launched

If you are interested into general contributions into deeper and more technical discussions you can look up at our forum [**OrivonStack**](https://orivonstack.com)

Then, your first question will probably be: "How I can actually help you?"

#### What roles I can get?

We are looking for various figures to contribute to Orivon  
Some hasn't any pre-requisite skill needed to begin and you will learn by doing

Feel free to choose the one you like the most:

- **🟢 Community builder** *includes finding key connetions, making systems for community growth, project diffusion etc...*
- **🟢 C++ Developer** *build the core of Orivon Browser, based on a brave browser hard fork*
- **HTML/CSS/JS Developer** *work along C++ devs to build the UI*
- **NodeJS Developer** *build MVP's, example implementations and scripts*
- **Collaborator** *If you are unsure of what role to take or isn't listed here you can get in touch with us so we can work on it*

Figures we will eventually look up for in the future:

- **Solidity Developer** *build the DAO rules based on Aragon or OZ Governance*
- **Supporter** *funding and grants*

#### Where I can propose myself?
